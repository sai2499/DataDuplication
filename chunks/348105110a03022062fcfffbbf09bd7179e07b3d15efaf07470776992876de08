ulture and work on ways to keep true to the core values that the company was founded on.[208] Google has also faced allegations of sexism and ageism from former employees.[209][210] In 2013, a class action against several Silicon Valley companies, including Google, was filed for alleged "no cold call" agreements which restrained the recruitment of high-tech employees.[211]

Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California is referred to as "the Googleplex", a play on words on the number googolplex and the headquarters itself being a complex of buildings. Internationally, Google has over 78 offices in more than 50 countries.[212]

In 2006, Google moved into about 300,000 square feet (27,900 m2) of office space in New York City, at 111 Eighth Avenue in Manhattan. The office was designed and built specially for Google, and houses its largest advertising sales team, which has been instrumental in securing large partnerships.[213] In 2010, Google bought the building housing the headquarter, in a deal that valued the property at around $1.9 billion.[214][215] In March 2018, Google's parent company Alphabet bought the nearby Chelsea Market building for $2.4 billion. The sale is touted as one of the most expensive real estate transactions for a single building in the history of New York.[216][217][218][219] In November 2018, Google announced its plan to expand its New York City office to a capacity of 12,000 employees.[220] The same December, it was announced that a $1 billion, 1,700,000-square-foot (160,000 m2) headquarters for Google would be built in Manhattan's Hudson Square neighborhood.[221][222] Called Google Hudson Square, the new campus is projected to more than double the number of Google employees working in New York City.[223]

By late 2006, Google established a new headquarters for its AdWords division in Ann Arbor, Michigan.[224] In November 2006, Google opened offices on Carnegie Mellon's campus in Pittsburgh, focusing on shopping-related advertisement coding and smartphone applications and programs.[225][226] Other office locations in the U.S. include Atlanta, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Boulder, Colorado; Cambridge, Massachusetts; San Francisco, California; Seattle, Washington; Kirkland, Washington; Birmingham, Michigan; Reston, Virginia, and Washington, D.C.[227]

It also has product research and development operations in cities around the world, namely Sydney (birthplace location of Google Maps)[228] and London (part of Android development).[229] In November 2013, Google announced plans for a new London headquarter, a 1 million square foot office able to accommodate 4,500 employees. Recognized as one of the biggest ever commercial property acquisitions at the time of the deal's announcement in January,[230] Google submitted plans for the new headquarter to the Camden Council in June 2017.[231][232] In May 2015, Google announced its intention to create its own campus in Hyderabad, India. The new campus, reported to be the company's largest outside the United States, will accommodate 13,000 employees.[233][234]

Google data centers are located in North and South America, Asia, and Europe.[235] There is no official data on the number of servers in Google data centers; however, research and advisory firm Gartner estimated in a July 2016 report that Google at the time had 2.5 million servers.[236] Traditionally, Google relied on parallel computing on commodity hardware like mainstream x86 computers (similar to home PCs) to keep costs per query low.[237][238][239] In 2005, it started developing its own designs, which were only revealed in 2009.[239]

In the late 2010s, Google began to build its own private submarine communications cables. The first, named Curie, connects California with Chile and is to be completed in 2019.[240] The second fully Google-owned under
