 Google can handle it. Alphabet, Google's parent company, made a profit of $2.5 billion (2.2 billion) in the first six weeks of 2017 alone. The real impact of the ruling is that Google must stop using its dominance as a search engine to give itself the edge in another market: online price comparisons." The company disputed the ruling.[282]

On July 18, 2018,[283] the European Commission fined Google 4.34 billion for breaching EU antitrust rules. The abuse of dominant position has been referred to Google's constraint applied on Android device manufacturers and network operators to ensure that traffic on Android devices goes to the Google search engine. On October 9, 2018, Google confirmed[284] that it had appealed the fine to the General Court of the European Union.[285]

On January 21, 2019, French data regulator CNIL imposed a record 50 million fine on Google for breaching the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation. The judgment claimed Google had failed to sufficiently inform users of its methods for collecting data to personalize advertising. Google issued a statement saying it was "deeply committed" to transparency and was "studying the decision" before determining its response.[286]

On March 20, 2019, the European Commission imposed a 1.49 billion ($1.69 billion) fine on Google for preventing rivals from being able to "compete and innovate fairly" in the online advertising market.[287] European Union competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said Google had violated EU antitrust rules by "imposing anti-competitive contractual restrictions on third-party websites" that required them to exclude search results from Google's rivals. Kent Walker, Google's senior vice-president of global affairs, said the company had "already made a wide range of changes to our products to address the Commission's concerns," and that "we'll be making further updates to give more visibility to rivals in Europe."[288]

Notes

    Google was originally incorporated on September 4, 1998, however, since 2002, the company has celebrated its anniversaries on various days in September, most frequently on September 27.[1][2][3] The shift in dates reportedly happened to celebrate index-size milestones in tandem with the birthday.[4]
