f Google employees, including senior engineers, have signed a letter urging Google CEO Sundar Pichai to end a controversial contract with the Pentagon.[275] In response to the backlash, Google ultimately decided to not renew their DoD contract, set to expire in 2019.[276]

Shona Ghosh, a journalist for Business Insider, noted that an increasing digital resistance movement against Google has grown. A major hub for critics of Google in order to organize to abstain from using Google products is the Reddit page for the subreddit /r/degoogle.[277]

In April 2019 former Mozilla executive has accused Google of intentionally and systematically sabotaging Firefox browser over the past decade in order to boost Chrome's adoption.[278] This was not the first time such controversies were reported. In July 2018, Mozilla Program Manager Chris Peterson accused Google of intentionally slowing down YouTube performance on Firefox.[279]
Litigation
Main article: Google litigation

Google has been involved in a number of lawsuits including the High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation which resulted in Google being one of four companies to pay a $415 million settlement to employees.[280]

On June 27, 2017, the company received a record fine of 2.42 billion from the European Union for "promoting its own shopping comparison service at the top of search results."[281] Commenting on the penalty, New Scientist magazine said: "The hefty sum - the largest ever doled out by the EU's competition regulators - will sting in the short term, but Google can handle it. Alphabet, Google's parent company, made a profit of $2.5 billion (2.2 billion) in the first six weeks of 2017 alone. The real impact of the ruling is that Google must stop using its dominance as a search engine to give itself the edge in another market: online price comparisons." The company disputed the ruling.[282]

On July 18, 2018,[283] the European Commission fined Google 4.34 billion for breaching EU antitrust rules. The abuse of dominant position has been referred to Google's constraint applied on Android device manufacturers and network operators to ensure that traffic on Android devices goes to the Google search engine. On October 9, 2018, Google confirmed[284] that it had appealed the fine to the General Court of the European Union.[285]

On January 21, 2019, French data regulator CNIL imposed a record 50 million fine on Google for breaching the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation. The judgment claimed Google had failed to sufficiently inform users of its methods for collecting data to personalize advertising. Google issued a statement saying it was "deeply committed" to transparency and was "studying the decision" before determining its response.[286]

On March 20, 2019, the European Commission imposed a 1.49 billion ($1.69 billion) fine on Google for preventing rivals from being able to "compete and innovate fairly" in the online advertising market.[287] European Union competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said Google had violated EU antitrust rules by "imposing anti-competitive contractual restrictions on third-party websites" that required them to exclude search results from Google's rivals. Kent Walker, Google's senior vice-president of global affairs, said the company had "already made a wide range of changes to our products to address the Commission's concerns," and that "we'll be making further updates to give more visibility to rivals in Europe."[288]

Notes

    Google was originally incorporated on September 4, 1998, however, since 2002, the company has celebrated its anniversaries on various days in September, most frequently on September 27.[1][2][3] The shift in dates reportedly happened to celebrate index-size milestones in tandem with the birthday.[4]
